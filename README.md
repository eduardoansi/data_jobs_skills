# Data science jobs required skills

I decided to do a little research about what are the most coveted skills for a data scientist applying for a job in this field.

Locations are selected based on my personal preferences, but they are probably significant enough to give a big picutre.

### Current version:

- Checks if terms in a "data science glossary" appear in job descriptions at least once;
- Rank how many jobs contain each term.

### Next steps:

- Combine terms that mean the same thing (e.g. nosql and no-sql / english and ingl√©s);
- Analyze combination of terms in job descriptions;
- Interactive charts for location and advanced analysis;

### Datasets

I uploaded the glossary with many big data / data science terms and tools. It will be updated as new sources are found.

The jobs spreadsheet contains sensitive information, therefore it was not added. I can help obtaining the data if needed though!
